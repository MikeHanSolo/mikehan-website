# Mike Han's Website
Built as a static website using HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript (jQuery). Most animations were constructed without the use of external libraries (outside of jQuery) in order to reduce external dependencies.

**Now optimized for GitHub Spark static hosting!**

## External Dependencies
- jQuery for scroll animations and navigation styling
- [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) for landing page background animation
- [ICONS8 Line Awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) for icons styling

## Build Process
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Deployment
This website is now fully static and can be deployed to any static hosting service like GitHub Pages, GitHub Spark, Netlify, or Vercel.

## To-do List
- Modals for experience details on mobile
- Projects gallery
